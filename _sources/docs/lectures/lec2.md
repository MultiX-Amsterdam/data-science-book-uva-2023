(Last updated: Feb 20, 2023)

## Preparation

Read the [Smell Pittsburgh paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3369397).
- This project is an example of a data science pipeline.
- Reading this work will help you get a basic understanding of data science pipelines.
- You do not need to understand all techniques in the paper. Some of the techniques can be too difficult for you. Try your best to get the big picture.

## Materials

:::{note}
The slides were updated to correct some errors. So the new ones are different from the ones that were used in the lecture.
