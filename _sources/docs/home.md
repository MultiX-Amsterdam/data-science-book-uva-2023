## Schedule Outline

:::{warning}
This schedule may be changed during the development of this course.
:::

Below is the outline of weekly activities.
The term "notebook" refers to the Jupyter Notebook script.
The term "tutorial" refers to step-by-step guidences of a notebook script.
We strongly recommand you to bring your laptop during the lectures with tutorials.

:::{admonition} Preparation for Lectures
In the link for each lecture, there is a preparation section.
You **have to** prepare them before going to the lectures or tutorials.
If you come to the class without doing the preparation part, you may not be able to understand the contents of lectures or tutorials.
:::

- Week 1
  - [Lecture 1 (Feb 7)](lectures/lec1): Introduce the course and explain why data science is important using examples
  - [Assignment 1](assignments/hw1) (work session and self-study): Python programming warm-up (e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy)
  - [Lecture 2 (Feb 9)](lectures/lec2): Recap fundamentals of data science techniques (e.g., basic statistics, basic machine learning concepts, metrics to evaluate model performance)
- Week 2
  - [Lecture 3 (Feb 14)](modules/structured-data/overview-structured-data): `Tutorial` for the structured data processing module (using Jupyter Notebook)
  - Assignment 2 (work session and self-study): Structured data processing module
  - Lecture 4 (Feb 16): Explain details and more examples in the pipeline of processing structured data (e.g., sensor measurements, citizen reported smell ratings)
- Week 3
  - Lecture 5 (Feb 21): Overview of deep learning techniques and applications
  - Assignment 3 (work session and self-study): Practice mock-up exam
  - Lecture 6 (Feb 23): Guest lecture by [Dr. Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu) (an assistant professor from Penn State IST) to introduce how to work with crowdscourcing platforms in data science research and data annotation. This lecture will be given remotely (no physical lecture).
- Week 4
  - Mid-term Exam (Feb 28)
  - A lecture to discuss the mid-term exam
- Week 5
  - Lecture 7 (Mar 7): `Tutorial` for the text data processing module (using Jupyter Notebook)
  - Assignment 4 (work session and self-study): Text data processing module
  - Lecture 8 (Mar 9): Explain details and more examples in the pipeline of processing text data (e.g., topic modeling)
- Week 6

- Week 7
  - Lecture 11 (Mar 21): Introduce the human-centered approach in data science (e.g., human-centered metrics to evaluate models, human-in-the-loop machine learning, citizen participation in data analysis, research ethics, privacy issues, data biases, social impact of data science, algorithmic fairness, explainability, reproducibility, open science)
  - No assignment this week. Use the work session to prepare for the final exam (e.g., review and practice the course materials).
  - Lecture 12 (Mar 23): Guest lecture by [Dr. Jie Yang](https://yangjiera.github.io) (an assistant professor from TU Delft EWI) to give examples and talk about state-of-the-art research in Human-Centered AI. This lecture may be given physically or remotely.
